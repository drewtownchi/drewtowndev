I've been reluctant to have a blog forever. I've never known what I was going to say or who my audience was going to be but I feel like it is finally time. Forever I am looking at old projects to see how I accomplished something or trying to track down some old notes. This blog will be a repository of things I've learned for myself and hopefully teaching a few others along the way.

I'm ready, it's time, for another super nerdy technology focused blog.

This blog will be primarily about development using tools such as Vue.js, Gridsome, Tailwind, Netlify and anything else I'm finding interesting at the time. Occasionally I might throw in a few articles about travel, cooking, systems management or any other random thoughts.

The first series is going to be putting together this blog here! Getting everything set up for a super low-cost blog that serves static pages while still have an amazing development experience.

Stay tuned...
